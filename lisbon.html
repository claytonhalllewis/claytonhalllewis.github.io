<p>Last week I flew to Lisbon [001], with student Derek Riemer [002] to participate in the ASSETS Conference on Accessible Computing. Our hotel was quite near the Praca Marquis de Pombal. The Marquis is up on the pedestal behind Derek; he was the architect of the rebuilding of the city after the catastrophic earthquake of 1755.

<p>We arrived fairly early in the AM, too early to check in to the hotel, so we left our baggage and went out to resist jetlag by walking around the city. We began along the Avenida de Liberdade [003], a lovely boulevard with rows of palms and sycamores, and lots of statues, mainly of literary and artistic figures. There are also kiosks [004] to dispense refreshments later in the day. This fountain [005] feeds an elegant serpentine pool [006]. [007] remembers a composer and an actress.

<p>The buildings along the avenue illustrate a wide range of styles [008,009]. Some [010] are brightly colored. At the cross streets [011] one can see that the Avenida runs in a valley, with ridges along either side.

<p>At intervals there are grander, more civic or military monuments [012], and the avenue wides out into plazas to set them off [013, 014]. I wish I had taken a better picture of the building shown at left in [015]. Having looked it up (as you can, too) I can say that it is the Teatro Eden, a former cinema, opened in 1931. Invisible in my picture is the fact that what look like large windows are actually openings into a garden in a large atrium, backed by a curved glass wall. I can't tell if the atrium was part of the theater as originally built, or was introduced when the building was remodeled into high end apartments. 

<p>Many of the buildings, like that in [016], I couldn't place to period. The elaborate stonework resembles that on some of the older structures, but may be reproduction.

<p>As we approached the Praca Dom Pedro IV a running race was just breaking up, with lots of people in numbered bibs coming out of the square towards us. In the square itself there were the facilities for a large gathering [017]. This photo also gives a good view of the black and white marble paving that is ubiquitous in the city, in many patterns besides the waves shown here. I had always associated this kind of paving with Rio, but I suppose it originated here.

<p>The National Theater faces the plaza [018]. In front of it you can see a little buggy much like those that swarm around Delhi. I don't remember seeing them anywhere else. Picture [019] shows another.

<p>Dom Pedro himself is shown on his pedestal in [020] amd [021]. My guidebook says that the statue was not actually modeled on the man himself, but on the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico. Apparently this statue was en route to Mexico when word came of Maximilian's assassination, and the Portuguese got it at an attractive price.

<p>From the plaza we saw an interesting gothic structure up the slope [022], and set off to find it. We weren't successful, but did find ourselves in an attractive neighborhood with nice shops [023-026]. Further up we found a nice church [027] with subtly tinted stucco on the sides, and an area of interestingly arranged streets crisscrossed by trolley lines [028]. The statue [029] depicts Luis Vaz de Camoes, Portugal's greatest poet, in military garb (he served in the overseas militia as far afield as Goa.) Picture [030] shows two more churches (we saw many in this style) with differently colored stucco. Picture [031] shows one of the beautiful little trolleys that serve the area.

<p>As seen in [032] and [033], tile is big in Lisbon, and some facades are completely covered. Picture [034] shows not tile but actual pyramids protruding from the wall.

<p>We were now up on the ridge to the west of the Avenida, and turned north to return to our hotel. The bell in the tower in [035] rang as we passed, reminding us that it was Sunday. 

<p>We passed the top of one of the elevadores [036], trams that run on fixed routes up some of the steeper hills, and reached a belvedere [037] with a view looking east across the Avenida to the opposite ridge. The panorama in picture [001] was taken from here; that picture also shows part of a legend, done in tile, identifying the buildings in the view. This fountain [038] adorned a quiet park behind the belvedere.

<p>As we were walking along the Avenida, earlier, we had looked up a side street [039] and seen a structure with onion domes way up above. Now we passed it [040] at street level. This neighborhood, too, had interesting shops [041, 042]. As we made our way back downhill to the Avenida and our hotel, we saw a vine covered wall that was molting, shedding its vines in a sheet [043].

<p>Having gained admission to our hotel room, and cleaned up, we set out again, by Metro this time, and found a modest eatery for lunch. I had pasteis, famous custard tarts [044] of which I was to consume a good many during the visit.

<p>We rode the metro past the point where we had left the Avenida on foot, and found ourselves in an older area, part of the reconstruction of the late 18th C. Many of the side streets were lined with restaurant seating [045]. By chance we found one of the main streets, leading up to a ceremonial arch [046, 047], which opens onto to Praca do Comercio, on the banks of the Tagus. This Praca was the grandest yet, [048-051], lined on three sides by splendid arcaded buildings, and punctuated by a statue of King Jose I. The fourth side is open to the Tagus, of which more anon.

<p>From the praca we headed for the cathedral, passing this church [052], looking much older than 1834, its actual date.

<p>This alley [053], and the steps beyond, looked like a promising route up to the cathedral, but a shopman saved us a disappointment by waving us in another direction. We found the way up the steep slope [054] to the cathedral [055,056]. It was built on the site of a mosque, starting in 1147, soon after the reconquest. It has two organs, mounted opposite one another. In the picture, [057], you may be able to make out a feature I hadn't seen before, a layer of pipes jutting out horizontally, besides the usual vertical ones.

<p>Leaving the cathedral [058] we aimed further up hill towards the castle. In this oldest part of the city we passed the excavation of a Roman theater [059], and a nice square with another baroque church [060]. Darkness overtook us, though, and we headed back down into the 18th C area [061] and took the metro back to the hotel.

<p>By now people were turning up for the conference, so we joined some colleagues for dinner at a restaurant along the Avenida. I had a traditional grilled pork dish [062], with Flea's Delight [063] for dessert. Of course is wasn't called that, but it tasted authentic despite the nut topping. Pictures [064-066] show other dinners I consumed during the visit, including grilled cod and a cous cous that came in a domed pot.

<p>The conference reception, on Tuesday night, was held in the Natural History Museum. The lobby contained a baffling art installation, made of bamboo [067]. We threaded through that to the chemistry lecture hall [068, 069] where awards for the conference were given out. The director of the museum gave us a little tour of the adjacent 19th C lab facilities, all that was saved when the museum burned in 1978.

<p>As sometimes happens, the food at the reception was insufficient to hold us, and we set out for a restaurant nearby. Our route took us down a steep hill [071], passing a large round finial on which someone has painted facial features [072].

<p>After the closing of the conference on Wednesday we and others took a cab out to Belem, along the Tagus west of the city. There we visited the Jeronimos Monastery [073-076]. The pretzel-like carving [077] around the cloister was extraordinary. Picture [078] shows our party, all Boulderites except for Reuben from Newcastle U, whose last name I didn't learn. The refectory [079] was set up for a private function, and we were running out of time before closing, and couldn't explore much. We did find the tomb of Alexandre Herculano [080], a revered liberal historian and novelist of the 19th C, and were able to see the church [081-084], which did not close. The high point for me, which I almost missed in the gloom, was the sarcophagus of Vasco da Gama [085].

<p>We left the monastery [086] and headed toward the river, passing an area of formal gardens and fountains [087, 088], leading to a monument to the Discoverers [089].  We were hoping to get a look at the Torre de Belem, of which more below, which was along the river to the east, but our view was blocked by other structures.

<p>We then walked a few blocks to a bakery that specializes in pasteis, those custard tarts, and is world famous for them. They do a big takeout trade [090], but also have seating [091]. I had a couple of the tarts, which are wonderful when fresh and warm, along with an excellent cup of chocolate [092]. Wine, beer, pizza, and various quiches completed the meal [093]. In the corridor of the bakery we found a model of the Torre de Belem [094], compensating us for not seeing the real thing.

<p>Our tram back to the city dropped us off short of the metro stop, which proved forunate as we found a shop [095] that sold nothing but sardines. The picture shows only a fraction of the stock. Sadly, they had only a single product with mustard sauce, the only treatment of sardines that I enjoy, and that was mackerel. I bought a few cans, anyway.

<p>A short walk took us to the Praca do Comercio [096], where we walked down to the water's edge, passing this unusual pavenment level walk sign [097]. Strangely, someone was clamming in the mud right by the edge of the square [098]. It would have been fitting to embark for home right from there, but we went back to the hotel, and to the airport the next day, instead.
