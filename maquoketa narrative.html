<h1>Iowa Road Trip (with a few family connections)</h2>
(Photos, consecutive as in this narrative, in <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/117182701258899946980/Maquoketa?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCM3GzOe3w9Ko_QE&feat=directlink"> this album.</a>)

<p>On a recent Friday through Monday I rented a little white Fiat [i010] and put in 2100 miles driving to Maquoketa Caves State Park in Iowa and back. Why?

<p>In 1961 our family (less John) made an epic car camping trip from Weston (CT) to Mandan (ND), Yellowstone, Zion, Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde, Fort Collins (CO), Cuernavaca (Mexico), and home. Along the way we stopped at Maquoketa Caves, and after pitching the tent (as was our duty) Manda and I walked in the dusk down to the cave entrance. It looked interesting, but it was getting dark, and time for a late supper, and we knew we could come back in the morning for a proper look. We were wrong! In the wee hours Dad roused the camp and commanded an emergency retreat. A thunderstorm was making up, and he was worried that a little stream, that crossed the entrance road to the park, would overflow, trapping us there until it subsided. (In hindsight I believe he was worried about getting to Minneapolis, our next stop, in time to take a flight back to Maine, where Grammie was seriously ill.) So Manda and I never got to see the caves. That's been on my mind ever since.

<p>Then a few years ago some colleagues and I visited Iowa State in Ames, to learn about some innovations they've made in assigning faculty roles. As I idly examined the tourist brochures in the hotel lobby, I noted that there were a multitude of interesting little museums in the region, and I thought it would be fun to have some time some day to explore them. The National Spam Museum is one I remember noticing (though that one's actually in Minnesota).

<p>These motives came together with a couple of free days, before the looming start of the semester next week. So with some logistical help from Jonathan Lutz, who suggested just renting a car and driving, rather than flying to (say) Chicago, and from Alcinda, who told me I should rent the car in town rather than (as Costco would have had me do) getting it out at the airport, I took the plunge.

<p>My route took me diagonally to the northeast corner of Colorado, and across Nebraska (a very long state) to a campground on the western outskirts of Omaha, where I pitched the little blue tent that Alcinda and I got for our honeymoon [i020]. Thence I crossed into Iowa, where I noodled around for two days, camping Saturday night outside Decorah [i030], in the northeast corner of the state, then staying the last night in a hotel in Red Oak, in the southwest corner, and grinding back across Nebraska and Colorado on the final day.

<p>Much of the route was along Route 6 [i040], which also goes near our old place in Croton Falls, and near family places in CT. Outside Lincoln one of the communities has put up fancy restored markers for the Denver to Detroit Highway [i050]. It's paralleled by I80 in this area.

<h2>The Landscape</h2>

The main impression of the Iowa landscape is height. It's rolling, not flat, and one can often see far out and down, a long, long way. Like the table lands jutting up from the Venezuela savannas, or the scattered towers of the tourist hotels in the sandy land around Orlando, one can see the farmsteads, with their silos, and their windbreak groves of trees, dotted here and there out to the horizon [i060]. Much of the land is in corn, and as one passes the pattern of the rows shifts and twirls, in a way not visible in a photo [i062]. At the edges, the land drops off quite sharply to the big rivers, confirming the sense of height.

<p>There must be a lot of wind up on top. There were lots and lots of big wind turbines all over the state, of which these [i068] are just a small sample.

<p>I hadn't realized that Iowa has lots of canoeing water. Here's one of many inviting river crossings [i070, i072], this one adjacent to the campground near Decorah. Everywhere there are signs for posted canoe access points.

<p>The little towns are in transition. Their original function as centers of farming areas has shrunk, as the farm population has, and as driving to bigger if more distant centers has become easier [i080]. The wide streets remain [i090], and, in some, tourism and commuters (from Omaha, for example) are bringing new kinds of business [i100]. 

<h2>The attractions</h2>

I stopped for a look around in Lincoln, NE. There were the state capitol, [i110], and the campus of the University of Nebraska. That has some nice older buildings [i120, i130], and some bauhaus-ish ones [i140], and of course a very large football stadium [i150]. That evening my supper was my first and so far only score at one of the establishments honored on the Road Food Web site, Runza's, serving cabbage, ground meat, and cheese, on a roll [i160]. I wasn't in Lincoln in time to take in the National Museum of Roller Skating, or the American Society of Germans from Russia International Headquarters.

<p>Next morning a woman at the Iowa Welcome Center directed me to a bakery [i170, i180] in Webster, Iowa. Webster fills its shop fronts with antiqueries [i190], being close enough to Omaha to draw custom.

<p>I80 goes near the Amana Colonies [i200, i210]. The Federal Writers' Project Guide for Iowa, which I had checked out for reference on the trip, informed me that the colony reorganized in 1932, in response to the pressures of the depression. In 1938, when the guide was written, the scene was still pretty peaceful, but now the tourist traffic is heavy. The simple architecture of the colony is still intact, mostly, but the tranquility is not. [i220] shows part of a parade of antique cars coming from a big show on a side street.

<p>The car rental rep, as it happened a lad from Iowa, tipped me off that his hometown, Lisbon, would be celebrating its Sauerkraut Festival that weekend. It was on my way, so I was able to take in their auto show [i230, i240, i250], and get some kraut dogs from one of the stands [i260]. I had them for supper that night [i270], and I must say it was by quite a bit the best sauerkraut I've ever had.

<p>After seeing the caves (of which below) I made my way to camp outside Decorah to be near Spillville, Iowa, where I planned to visit the site of Antonin Dvorak's Iowa sojourn of 1893. The museum there wouldn't open til noon, so I mapped out some other activities.

<p>Decorah itself is a pleasant town, with well-groomed Luther College on the outskirts [i280, i290, i300]. Downtown that are some handsome buildings [i310, i320. Besides some yuppie eateries it had a proper breakfast place, with featured cinnamon rolls [i330, i340]. It also has Vesterheim, the National Norwegian-American Museum and Heritage Center [i350], which suprisingly was open Sunday morning. This is a wonderful place, with lovely exhibits of all kinds of things Norwegian [i360, i362], including rosemaling older [i370] and newer [i380]. [i390] reminded me of our old toy bureau. There's a treatment of a special unit of Norwegian speakers raised for duty in WWII, and trained with the 10th Mountain Division, in Camp Hale, CO [i400]. There's also a small boat, in which two brothers emigrated from Norway to the US [i410]. Outside are some of the early cabins from the area [i420]. Besides the exhibits Vesterheim offers classes in Norwegian folk arts, keeping tradition alive [i430]. It's been visited several times by Norwegian royalty [i440]. One of the houses nearby has forgotten what sort of Scandinavian heritage it is supposed to celebrate [i450].

<p>I then drove over to the Mississippi to see Effigy Mounds National Monument, on the heights overlooking the river. The Monument holds 206 mounds, several in the form of bears and birds. This one [i460] is a bear, about 80 feet long. To your left is the head, and coming towards you on the right is the front leg. This shot [i470] shows a couple in a long chain of circular mounds. There's a wonderful view of the river from the site [i480].

<p>I had learned from the Allamakee County tourist brochure that Postville, IA, was the boyhood home of John R. Mott, and I was able to swing through there on my way back to Spillville (actually, I had been through on my way north the day before, but hadn't yet scanned that brochure.) Mott was the man with whom Grampa Hall met in NYC, after graduating from Worcester Tech, to redeem his pledge to the student volunteer movement. Mott took from his pocket the fateful cable from the YMCA in Tientsin that drew Grampa to China. I learned from the Allamakee brochure, and from the plaque outside the Mott home in Postville [i490, i500], that Mott went on the win the Nobel Peach Prize for his work in founding the World Council of Churches. Postville, like some other similar farm towns, now has quite a few Latino residents [i510].

<p>In Spillville (named for a founder named Spiel) I was looking not only for Dvorak memories but also for the Bily Brothers Clock Museum, which I had learned of when researching the village online. Conveniently I found that the clock museum, and exhibits devoted to Dvorak's visit, are both housed in the building in the village where Dvorak and his family spent the summer of 1893 [i520]. The "clocks" (the word hardly does them justice) were made by bachelor Czech brothers who farmed near the village, and occupied their winters making enormous sculptures in carved wood, up to nine feet in height. Several contain music boxes or mechanical organs, and many have moving elements, starting with the processing figures often seen on traditional clocks, and going much beyond. In one a mechanical blacksmith perpetually beats on a plowshare. After the first few constructions, which were fairly conventional, though ornate, each has some kind of intellectual theme, which is expressed very differently in each clock. The learning conveyed by them, and the fresh mode of conception and expression shown in each, are astounding in the works of men who never went past the fifth grade. Unfortunately photography is not permitted in the clock gallery, so I have to be satisfied here with two postcards, [i530] showing the blacksmith, and [i540] showing one of the older models.

<p>The staff of the museum directed me to the Dvorak Memorial [i550], in a nearby riverside park, where the composer used to walk in the evening to develop new compositional ideas. The park also houses the town ballroom [i560], a traditional design of which few remain. They also directed me to the town bandstand [i570], depicted on one of the clocks, and to St. Wenceslaus church [i580], where Dvorak performed on the organ during his visit.

<p>My last objective, in the southwest part of the state, closer to home, was the farmhouse where Henry Wallace, secretary of agriculture, secretary of commerce, and vice president, was born. I recently read a biography of him, and was impressed that he was a noble and constructive character, kept from the presidency by the machinations of politicians who feared the impact of his progressive values on their activities. With the consent of the ailing FDR he was excluded from the 1944 ticket, and his enemies also got him out of the Truman cabinet. He ran as a progressive in 1948, with Paul Robeson prominent among his supporters. Wallace's platform of racial equality was (it seems) premature, and he was smeared and marginalized vigorously. The tag of "dreamer" was successfully attached to him, despite his being (in addition to the above) the scientist founder of Pioneer Hi-Bred, eventually sold to Dupont for an estimated $10B (and once the employer of Ted Lewis.) 

<p>It was dark by the time I reached the area (Orient, Iowa), and I would never have found the house without the aid of Google Navigation. It took me right to the place, on a back road off a back road [i590]. Later it told me that my hotel in Red Oak was right next to where I had paused to seek directions.

<h2>The caves</h2>

You can't go home again, and you can't even really go back to a state park. I did find it, of course, but the landscape is nothing like what I remembered. A little reflection reminded me that 54 years is long enough for quite a growth of woods. I remember the campground, and the area through which the approach road ran, as being very open. Just behind our tent was a bean field, in which lizards were singing. Today there's no open ground; the campground and the surroundings are all wooded [i600]. 

<p>Of course I can't be sure that the campground hasn't been relocated, and so I can't be sure that the path Manda and I followed to the cave entrance all those years ago is the one I followed on this visit. And it was pretty dark, as I've said, when we two saw the approach to the caves. I remember being unsure whether these were real caves, or just spaces between big boulders, whereas today, in the daylight, it's obvious they are real. These pictures show the scene we may have dimly glimpsed [i610, i620]. Here are a few pictures of things we didn't see, on our aborted visit [i630, i640].

<p>The next day, up by Decorah, I found there was a bean field next to the campground up there [i650].

<h2>Things I couldn't photograph</h2>

For some reason only a few Iowa farmers seem to realize that a farmstead has a white house, a red barn, and a silo, as in a toy farm set. I did see a few just like that, but couldn't stop to get a picture. This one [i660] is close, but has the wrong color barn.

<p>I passed through McGregor, Iowa, right on the Mississippi, without time to stop. It's a happening place, with nice old buildings, and (it appears) a good deal of tourism. Near there I didn't manage to get a picture of the signs marking Clayton County. Nor was I able to get a picture of a towboat and barges, moored in the river just next to the highway.
