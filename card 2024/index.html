        <h2>&#x2761;&#x2761;&#x2761; Ten Tokens for the New Year &#x2761;&#x2761;&#x2761;</h2>
        As 2023 drew towards its end I asked an old Large Language model for ten tokens (syllables, more or less) of prognostication (the new models are too wordy for my taste). I've gathered the outputs for many versions of a prompt, filling in the names of friends. If you put in your name, you'll get a selection from this collection... it might even be the actual one for your name!
